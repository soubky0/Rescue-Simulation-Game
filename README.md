# Rescue Simulation Game

## Overview

The Rescue Simulation Game is a 2D grid-based simulation game developed in Java using JavaFX. The game simulates various disaster scenarios where the player manages a fleet of emergency units to rescue citizens and mitigate disasters.

## Features

- **Dynamic Simulation**: Simulates various disasters including fires, gas leaks, infections, injuries, and building collapses.
- **Interactive UI**: Engaging user interface built with JavaFX, providing real-time updates on the simulation status.
- **Command Center**: Central control to handle SOS calls, manage emergency units, and oversee the overall simulation.
- **Automated Testing**: Utilized JUnit for testing critical modules to ensure reliability and reduce regression bugs.
- **Data-Driven**: Loads units, buildings, citizens, and disasters from CSV files for a dynamic and scalable simulation environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **JavaFX**
- **JUnit**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/soubky0/Rescue-Simulation-Game.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Rescue-Simulation-Game
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    - Use your preferred Java IDE to import the project and run `src/controller/CommandCenter.java`.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Simulation**: Run the application to initiate the simulation environment.
2. **Manage Disasters**: Use the command center to respond to SOS calls and deploy emergency units to disaster sites.
3. **Monitor Status**: Keep track of the current cycle, casualties, and the state of emergency units and disasters.
